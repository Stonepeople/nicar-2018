# This is my practice document
I am hoping to increase my Git Fu with a short 1-hour course at the Investigative Reporters and Editors Computer Assisted Reporting [NICAR](http://ire.org) conference in Chicago.
Nothing more to see here, _really_. 

## This is where my data will go

There's no actual data yet. Because this is not a real project.
## This is where my data analysis will be described.
Maybe not. Since there's no actual data analysis going on here.
